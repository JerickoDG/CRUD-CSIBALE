# CRUD-CSIBALE System
This project is made for the completion of my Software Design course along with my colleagues.
***

The client is a non-government organization (NGO) with a mission to assist and create opportunities for children with disabilities which are their beneficiaries.
To conveniently keep records of their beneficiaries' information, this Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) application was developed which enables them to do the following:
* Add beneficiary records to the database
* Retrieve and view all beneficiaries with sorting mechanism
* Retrieve and view specific beneficiaries by providing search filters
* Remove single or multiple beneficiary records from the database
* Data Visualization of beneficiary records
